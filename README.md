Quantum Computing Overview : A standalone graduate level literature summary of quantum computing fundamentals

QML_BSM : presentation given on quantum machine learning for beyond standard model physics.
QML_BSM_2 : second part of the presentation given on QML for beyond standard model.

QML_Molecule : presentation given on quantum machine learning for drug discovery. This was a group project for a class with one more team member. 
QML_molecule_report : report created on the literature review for QML for drug discovery for the class. The report is structured by us but language has been enhanced using AI tools.

descriptors : this report contains my interpretation of the importance of descriptors from a CS major point of view. The report contains descriptors from 3 fields, AI for molecules, AI for magnets and AI for particle physics
